### Concept

`Loop` is a self-contained digital art piece created in a single HTML file. It explores themes of purpose, existentialism, and endless loops through a minimalist and atmospheric animation. A lone figure, The Traveler, journeys on a circular track, pausing each lap to question a silent, monolithic computer, The Terminus, before continuing on its way.

The piece features a moody, dark aesthetic with a generative particle system and a retro TV effect to create an immersive, thought-provoking experience.

### Features

* **Pure HTML/CSS/JS:** A single file with no external dependencies.
* **CSS Animations:** The core loop, cart details, and ambient effects are all animated with CSS.
* **JavaScript State Management:** A simple but robust JS cycle manager controls when the cart stops, dialogue appears, and the journey resumes, ensuring perfect timing without glitches.
* **Retro TV Overlay:** A composite overlay of scan lines and animated static noise provides a nostalgic, CRT monitor feel.
* **Atmospheric Design:** A dark palette, glowing cyan highlights, and a monospace font create a cohesive, dystopian mood.
